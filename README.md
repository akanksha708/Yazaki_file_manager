# Yazaki_file_manager
A GUI-based software “Applicator Drawing Control Management” which maintains the logs and database of the part drawings and ensures secure access to these files. 
The software would organize the PDFs containing part drawings on the Local Server of the company and update their logs with every new revision. It would keep the documents sorted in the respective folders depending upon the latest revision of a particular file and would ensure secure access to these documents.
